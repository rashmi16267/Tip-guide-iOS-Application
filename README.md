# Tip-guide-iOS-Application

ABSTRACT
- The hospitality and culinary industry is thriving in India. 
- However, tipping for a service according to the level of customer satisfaction is fairly a new concept in India. 
- With the introduction of fine dining and other high-quality services, tipping is now a question of ethics and a socially acceptable practice based on the experience of the consumer/customer. 
- The mobile application, Tip Guide, is a guide to tipping according to the quality of the service. 
- Customers will also be able to rate and write reviews on the restaurant/service. 
- The recommendation for the tip will be calculated according to the bill and the quality of the experience at the given place for the particular customer. 
- Restaurants may use this app to view first-hand reviews from their customers and check the specific areas (food, ambiance, service, hygiene) that require improvement. 
- This project is an iOS application developed using Swift language on Xcode, targeting iOS platforms.
